# Educational Content
addressExplanation=A blockchain address is a unique identifier that represents a location on the blockchain where transactions can be sent. Think of it like a bank account number.
transactionExplanation=A transaction hash is a unique identifier for each blockchain transaction. You can use it to track the status and details of your transaction on the blockchain.
contractExplanation=Smart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain that automatically carry out agreements when conditions are met.
gasExplanation=Gas fees are small payments made to the network to process your transaction. Higher fees typically result in faster processing.
confirmationExplanation=Confirmations represent how many blocks have been added to the blockchain since your transaction. More confirmations mean higher security.
