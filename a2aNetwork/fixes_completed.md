   - Database connection established (HANA)
   - Authentication system initialized (XSUAA)
   - Security middleware applied
   - All CDS models compiled successfully

## 🚀 **Application Startup Log**

```
[cds] - loading server from { file: 'srv/server.js' }
XSUAA JWT strategy initialized successfully
[cds] - loaded model from 4 file(s):
  srv/blockchain-service.cds
  srv/a2a-service.cds
  db/schema.cds
  node_modules/@sap/cds/common.cds
[cds] - connect to db > hana
[cds] - serving A2AService { impl: 'srv/a2a-service.js', path: '/api/v1' }
[cds] - serving BlockchainService { impl: 'blockchain-service.js', path: '/odata/v4/blockchain' }
```

## 🔧 **Key Fixes Applied**

### CDS Compilation Fixes
- Fixed reserved word `from` → `![from]` in blockchain events
- Resolved localized texts entity conflicts
- Cleaned up entity definitions

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Production**

1. **Start Application** (resolve port conflict): 
   ```bash
   PORT=4005 npm start
   ```

2. **Deploy Contracts** (if blockchain network available):
   ```bash
   forge build && forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/AgentRegistry.sol:AgentRegistry
   ```

3. **Run Security Audit**:
   ```bash
   npm run security:audit
   ```

4. **Access Application**:
   - API: http://localhost:4004/api/v1
   - Health Check: http://localhost:4004/health
   - Fiori UI: http://localhost:4004/app/a2a-fiori
