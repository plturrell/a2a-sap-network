- [ ] Automated retraining

## Critical Metrics to Track

### Performance
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Error rate
- Availability (99.9% SLA)

### Business
- API usage by endpoint
- Active clients/users
- Request patterns
- Resource utilization

### Security
- Failed auth attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious patterns
- Vulnerability scan results

## Recommended Tools

### Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logs**: ELK Stack or Splunk
- **Tracing**: Jaeger or Zipkin
- **APM**: New Relic or DataDog

### Security
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault
- **Scanning**: Snyk or SonarQube
- **WAF**: Cloudflare or AWS WAF
- **SIEM**: Splunk or Elastic Security

### Infrastructure
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI or GitHub Actions
- **IaC**: Terraform or Pulumi

## Budget Considerations

### Minimum Production Setup (~$500/month)
- 3 MCP server instances (load balanced)
- Redis cache
- PostgreSQL database
- Basic monitoring

### Recommended Setup (~$2000/month)
- 9 MCP servers (3x redundancy)
- Redis cluster
- PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Full monitoring stack
- CDN for static assets

### Enterprise Setup (~$10,000/month)
- Multi-region deployment
- Full redundancy
- Advanced monitoring/APM
- Dedicated security tools
- 24/7 support

## Success Criteria

1. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
2. **Performance**: <100ms p95 latency
3. **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
4. **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic spikes
5. **Compliance**: Pass security audits
