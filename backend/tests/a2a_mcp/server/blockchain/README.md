# Blockchain Test Infrastructure for A2A Agents

This directory contains the comprehensive blockchain testing infrastructure for the A2A agent network.

## Overview

This test suite was created to support the blockchain integration of all 16 A2A agents, providing:
- Unit testing with mocks for isolated testing
- Integration testing with local blockchain networks
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Complete documentation

## Files

- **`test_blockchain_integration.py`** - Unit tests for blockchain integration functionality
- **`test_blockchain_network_integration.py`** - Integration tests using local test networks (Anvil/Ganache)
- **`blockchain_monitoring.py`** - Real-time monitoring system for blockchain operations
- **`blockchain_error_handling.py`** - Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **`BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete implementation guide and best practices
- **`run_all_tests.py`** - Test runner that orchestrates all tests and demonstrations
- **`verify_infrastructure.py`** - Verification script to check infrastructure completeness

## Quick Start

1. Verify infrastructure:
   ```bash
   python3 verify_infrastructure.py
   ```

2. Run all tests (currently using mocks):
   ```bash
   python3 run_all_tests.py
   ```

3. Run unit tests only:
   ```bash
   python3 test_blockchain_integration.py
   ```

**Note**: The test suite currently uses mocks and stubs. Actual blockchain integration requires:
- Deployed smart contracts (AgentRegistry, MessageRouter, TrustManager)
- Configured agent private keys
- Blockchain client implementation

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

### Unit Tests
- Blockchain mixin initialization
- Message sending and receiving
- Trust verification
- Agent capability discovery
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Agent registration on blockchain
- Message routing between agents
- Trust and reputation management
- Multi-agent coordination
- Consensus building
- Error recovery

### Monitoring
- Transaction success rates
- Gas usage tracking
- Message latency monitoring
- Agent availability
- Health checks and alerts

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Graceful degradation
- State reconciliation
- Recovery strategies

## Architecture

The blockchain integration follows these patterns:
- **Mixin Pattern**: `BlockchainIntegrationMixin` for easy integration
- **Message Handlers**: `_handle_blockchain_*` naming convention
- **Trust-Based Access**: Reputation thresholds for operations
- **Event-Driven**: Async message listeners for real-time communication

## Key Features

1. **One Entity, One Address**: Each agent has a unique blockchain identity
2. **Trust Verification**: All operations verify sender reputation
3. **Blockchain-Verifiable Results**: All operations can be verified on-chain
4. **Collaborative Operations**: Agents can coordinate through blockchain
5. **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of network issues and failures

## Testing Without Blockchain

The test suite includes mocks and stubs, allowing tests to run without actual blockchain infrastructure. This enables:
- Fast unit testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Development without blockchain setup
- Testing of error scenarios

## Production Readiness

Before deploying to production:
1. Deploy smart contracts to target network
2. Configure agent private keys
3. Set appropriate gas limits
4. Enable monitoring alerts
5. Test recovery procedures

## Supported Agents

All 16 A2A agents are integrated:
1. agentManager
2. dataManager
3. qualityControlManager
4. agent4CalcValidation
5. agent5QaValidation
6. calculationAgent
7. catalogManager
8. agentBuilder
9. embeddingFineTuner
10. reasoningAgent
11. sqlAgent
12. testAgent
13. trustAgent
14. validationAgent
15. workflowAgent
16. coordinatorAgent

Each agent has unique blockchain capabilities and trust thresholds appropriate to their role in the network.

## Next Steps

1. Fix import issues for agents with missing dependencies
2. Deploy actual smart contracts
3. Configure production monitoring
4. Set up automated testing in CI/CD
5. Create performance benchmarks
