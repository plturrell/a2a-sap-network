## Quality Assessment

### Positive Findings:
1. **Consistent MCP Tool Implementation**: All MCP agents implement the 4 core tools:
   - Tool 1: Primary operation (e.g., create_data_product, standardize_data)
   - Tool 2: Validation operation
   - Tool 3: Enhancement/enrichment operation
   - Tool 4: Batch/streaming operation

2. **Consistent MCP Resource Implementation**: All implement 4 resources:
   - Resource 1: Catalog/registry view
   - Resource 2: Metadata/configuration view
   - Resource 3: Status/monitoring view
   - Resource 4: Cache/performance view

3. **Comprehensive Features**: Each MCP implementation includes:
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Caching systems
   - Streaming capabilities
   - Circuit breakers
   - Comprehensive validation

### Quality Improvements Made ✅:
1. **Agent-Specific Design**: Each agent now has unique, domain-specific MCP tools tailored to their functionality
2. **Conversational Prompts Added**: All agents now include 3 @mcp_prompt decorators for natural language interactions
