   - External penetration testing by SAP-approved vendor
   - Internal penetration testing
   - API security testing
   - Infrastructure security assessment

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

   - Container security scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

3. **Compliance Audits**
   - GDPR compliance assessment
