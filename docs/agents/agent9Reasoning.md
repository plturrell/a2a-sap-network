# Agent 9: Reasoning Agent

## Overview
The Reasoning Agent (Agent 9) provides advanced logical reasoning and decision-making capabilities to the A2A Network. It uses sophisticated inference algorithms and knowledge synthesis to solve complex problems and make intelligent decisions.

## Purpose
- Perform advanced logical reasoning on data
- Generate inferences from multiple data sources
- Make complex decisions based on rules and patterns
- Synthesize knowledge from various agents
- Solve problems requiring multi-step reasoning

## Key Features
- **Logical Reasoning**: Apply formal logic and inference rules
- **Inference Generation**: Create new insights from existing data
- **Decision Making**: Make intelligent choices based on criteria
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources
- **Problem Solving**: Navigate complex problem spaces

## Technical Details
- **Agent Type**: `reasoningAgent`
- **Agent Number**: 9
- **Default Port**: 8009
- **Blockchain Address**: `0xa0Ee7A142d267C1f36714E4a8F75612F20a79720`
- **Registration Block**: 12

## Capabilities
- `logical_reasoning`
- `inference_generation`
- `decision_making`
- `knowledge_synthesis`
- `problem_solving`

## Input/Output
- **Input**: Facts, rules, queries, data from multiple agents
- **Output**: Reasoned conclusions, decisions, recommendations

## Reasoning Architecture
```yaml
reasoningAgent:
  engines:
    - type: "forward_chaining"
      rules: "/config/business_rules.yaml"
    - type: "backward_chaining"
      goals: "/config/reasoning_goals.yaml"
    - type: "probabilistic"
      model: "bayesian_network"
  knowledge_base:
    sources:
      - "agent_data_manager"
      - "external_knowledge_graphs"
      - "historical_decisions"
  confidence_threshold: 0.85
```

## Usage Example
```python
from a2aNetwork.sdk import Agent

# Initialize Reasoning Agent
reasoning_agent = Agent(
    agent_type="reasoningAgent",
    endpoint="http://localhost:8009"
)

# Perform reasoning task
result = reasoning_agent.reason({
    "query": "Should we approve this financial transaction?",
    "facts": {
        "amount": 1000000,
        "risk_score": 0.3,
        "compliance_check": "passed",
        "historical_behavior": "normal"
    },
    "rules": [
        "IF risk_score < 0.5 AND compliance_check = passed THEN low_risk",
        "IF amount > 500000 AND low_risk THEN require_additional_review"
    ],
    "reasoning_type": "forward_chaining"
})

print(f"Decision: {result['conclusion']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
print(f"Reasoning path: {result['explanation']}")
```

## Reasoning Types
1. **Deductive**: From general rules to specific conclusions
2. **Inductive**: From specific cases to general patterns
3. **Abductive**: Best explanation for observations
4. **Analogical**: Reasoning by similarity
5. **Probabilistic**: Handling uncertainty

## Knowledge Representation
```json
{
  "facts": [
    {"subject": "transaction_123", "predicate": "has_amount", "object": 1000000},
    {"subject": "transaction_123", "predicate": "has_risk", "object": "low"}
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "if": [{"fact": "has_risk", "value": "low"}],
      "then": {"action": "approve", "confidence": 0.9}
    }
  ]
}
```
