5. **Query Capability**: Failed messages queryable for analysis and debugging

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **PASS**: All failed messages properly stored, capacity managed, cleanup works, queries accurate
- **FAIL**: Messages lost, capacity exceeded, cleanup malfunction, or query errors

### DLQ Test Scenarios

3. **Rapid Filling**: Quickly fill DLQ to capacity to test eviction
4. **Age-Based Cleanup**: Messages with varied ages for cleanup testing
5. **Error Pattern Analysis**: Common failure reasons for operational insights

### DLQ Message Examples
**Failed Message with Details**:
```python
failed_msg = QueuedMessage(
    message_id="dlq_fail_001",
    a2a_message={"messageId": "fail_001", "payload": {"test": "data"}},
    context_id="ctx_fail_001",
    status=QueuedMessageStatus.FAILED,
    error_message="ValueError: Invalid processing parameters",
    retry_count=3,
    started_at=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=5),
    completed_at=datetime.utcnow()
)
```

**Timeout Message**:
```python
timeout_msg = QueuedMessage(
    message_id="dlq_timeout_001",
    status=QueuedMessageStatus.TIMEOUT,
    error_message="Processing timeout after 60 seconds",
    timeout_seconds=60
)
```

**Cancelled Message**:
```python
cancelled_msg = QueuedMessage(
    message_id="dlq_cancel_001",
    status=QueuedMessageStatus.CANCELLED,
    completed_at=datetime.utcnow()
)
```

### DLQ Capacity Testing
```python
# Test deque capacity limit
for i in range(1500):  # Exceed maxlen=1000
    failed_msg = create_failed_message(f"overflow_{i}")
    queue._completed.append(failed_msg)

assert len(queue._completed) == 1000  # Capacity enforced
assert queue._completed[0].message_id == "overflow_500"  # First 500 evicted
```

### History Cleanup Testing
```python
# Create messages with different ages
old_msg = QueuedMessage(
    message_id="old_001",
    completed_at=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=48)
)
recent_msg = QueuedMessage(
    message_id="recent_001", 
    completed_at=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=12)
)

# Cleanup messages older than 24 hours
queue.clear_completed_history(older_than_hours=24)
```

3. **Queue Processor**: Background processor consuming messages in priority order
4. **Test Messages**: Multiple messages with different priorities and timestamps
5. **Thread Safety**: Queue operations protected by _queue_lock

### Test Input Data
| Parameter | Value | Type | Source |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| Agent ID | ordering_test_agent | String | Test Configuration |
| Critical Messages | 5 messages | List[QueuedMessage] | Priority.CRITICAL |
| High Messages | 10 messages | List[QueuedMessage] | Priority.HIGH |
| Medium Messages | 15 messages | List[QueuedMessage] | Priority.MEDIUM |
| Low Messages | 20 messages | List[QueuedMessage] | Priority.LOW |
| Timestamp Range | 0-60 seconds | Float | time.time() |

### Test Procedure Steps
1. **Step 1 - Priority Weight Verification**
   - Action: Verify priority weight mapping (CRITICAL=0, HIGH=1, MEDIUM=2, LOW=3)
   - Expected: Lower numeric weight equals higher processing priority
   - Verification: _priority_weights dictionary contains correct mappings

2. **Step 2 - Single Priority FIFO Ordering**
   - Action: Enqueue multiple messages with same priority but different timestamps
   - Expected: Messages processed in FIFO order (timestamp order) within priority
   - Verification: heappush tuple: (priority_weight, timestamp, message_id)

3. **Step 3 - Mixed Priority Ordering**
   - Action: Enqueue messages with all priority levels in random order
   - Expected: Messages consumed in priority order: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
   - Verification: heappop returns messages in correct priority sequence

4. **Step 4 - Priority Starvation Prevention**
   - Action: Continuously add CRITICAL messages while LOW messages queued
   - Expected: LOW messages eventually processed after CRITICAL queue empty
   - Verification: No messages stuck indefinitely due to priority

5. **Step 5 - Timestamp Tiebreaking**
   - Action: Enqueue messages with same priority at different times
   - Expected: Earlier timestamp processed first when priorities equal
   - Verification: Heap tuple comparison: (priority, timestamp) ordering

6. **Step 6 - Dynamic Priority Changes**
   - Action: Test re-queuing messages with different priorities (retry scenarios)
   - Expected: Re-queued messages inserted at new priority position
   - Verification: Message position in queue changes based on new priority

7. **Step 7 - Queue Depth Priority Distribution**
   - Action: Check queue status showing priority breakdown
   - Expected: get_queue_status() returns accurate priority distribution
   - Verification: priority_breakdown matches actual queue contents

8. **Step 8 - Concurrent Priority Enqueuing**
   - Action: Multiple threads enqueuing messages with different priorities
   - Expected: Thread-safe priority ordering maintained
   - Verification: No priority inversions due to race conditions

9. **Step 9 - Priority Preservation During Retries**
   - Action: Verify failed messages retain priority when re-queued
   - Expected: Retry messages maintain original priority weight
   - Verification: heappush uses same priority_weight on retry

10. **Step 10 - Performance Under Priority Load**
    - Action: Measure processing order with 1000+ mixed priority messages
    - Expected: Consistent priority ordering at scale
    - Verification: Statistical analysis shows correct priority distribution

### Expected Results
1. **Strict Priority Ordering**: Messages always processed in priority order
2. **FIFO Within Priority**: Same-priority messages maintain insertion order
3. **No Priority Inversion**: Higher priority never blocked by lower priority
4. **Timestamp Accuracy**: Microsecond timestamp precision for ordering
5. **Scalable Performance**: Priority ordering maintained with large queues

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **PASS**: All messages processed in correct priority order, FIFO within priorities maintained
- **FAIL**: Priority inversions detected, FIFO violations, or ordering inconsistencies

### Priority Test Scenarios
1. **Critical Message Burst**: 100 CRITICAL messages arrive simultaneously
2. **Mixed Priority Stream**: Continuous flow of all priority levels
3. **Priority Escalation**: Messages changing from LOW to CRITICAL
4. **Empty Queue Refill**: Queue empties and refills with new priorities
5. **Boundary Conditions**: Single message per priority level

### Message Ordering Examples
**Priority Queue Structure**:
```python
# Heap contains tuples: (priority_weight, timestamp, message_id)
_priority_queue = [
    (0, 1234567890.123, "critical_msg_001"),  # CRITICAL (weight=0)
    (1, 1234567890.456, "high_msg_001"),      # HIGH (weight=1)
    (1, 1234567890.789, "high_msg_002"),      # HIGH (weight=1, later timestamp)
    (2, 1234567890.111, "medium_msg_001"),    # MEDIUM (weight=2)
    (3, 1234567890.222, "low_msg_001")        # LOW (weight=3)
]
```

**FIFO Within Priority Test**:
```python
# Messages with same priority, different timestamps
messages = [
    ("msg_1", MessagePriority.HIGH, time.time()),
    ("msg_2", MessagePriority.HIGH, time.time() + 0.001),
    ("msg_3", MessagePriority.HIGH, time.time() + 0.002)
]
# Expected processing order: msg_1 → msg_2 → msg_3
```

**Priority Distribution Query**:
```python
status = queue.get_queue_status()
priority_breakdown = status["queue_status"]["priority_breakdown"]
# Example output:
# {
#     "critical": 2,
#     "high": 5,
#     "medium": 10,
#     "low": 3
# }
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```
Message Ordering Performance Targets:
- Priority enqueue operation: <1ms per message
- Heap operations (heappush/heappop): <0.1ms
- Priority weight lookup: <0.01ms
- Timestamp generation: <0.001ms
- Queue status calculation: <5ms for 1000 messages
```

### Concurrent Ordering Test
```python
import threading
import random

def enqueue_random_priority(queue, thread_id):
    for i in range(100):
        priority = random.choice(list(MessagePriority))
        message = create_test_message(f"thread_{thread_id}_msg_{i}")
        queue.enqueue_message(message, f"ctx_{thread_id}", priority)

# Launch multiple threads
threads = []
for t in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=enqueue_random_priority, args=(queue, t))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()
```

### Test Postconditions
- All messages processed in strict priority order
- FIFO ordering maintained within each priority level
- No messages lost or duplicated during ordering
- Queue statistics accurately reflect priority distribution

3. **Priority Weight Missing**: Default to MEDIUM priority
4. **Concurrent Modification**: Lock protection prevents inconsistency
5. **Integer Overflow**: Python handles large timestamps gracefully

### Validation Points

}
```

### Workflow Execution Example
```python
workflow_instance = WorkflowInstance(
    workflow_id="wf_route_test_001",
    context_id="ctx_route_001",
    agents_involved=["agent_processor", "agent_validator", "agent_output"],
    status=WorkflowStatus.PENDING,
    metadata={"routing_strategy": "sequential"}
)
```

### Agent Health Status Example
```python
registered_agents = {
    "agent_processor": RegisteredAgent(
        agent_id="agent_processor",
        status=AgentStatus.ACTIVE,
        capabilities=["data_processing"],
        health_check_failures=0
    ),
    "agent_validator": RegisteredAgent(

### Load Distribution Test Data
**Instance Configuration**:
```python
test_instances = [
    AgentInstance(
        agent_id="data_processor",
        instance_id="dp_instance_1",
        base_url="http://localhost:8001",
        weight=1,
        health_status="healthy",
        active_connections=5,
        response_times=deque([450, 500, 480])
    ),
    AgentInstance(
        agent_id="data_processor",
        instance_id="dp_instance_2",
        base_url="http://localhost:8002",
        weight=2,
        health_status="healthy",
        active_connections=2,
        response_times=deque([180, 200, 220])
    ),
    AgentInstance(
        agent_id="data_processor",
        instance_id="dp_instance_3",
        base_url="http://localhost:8003",
        weight=1,
        health_status="degraded",
        active_connections=3,
        response_times=deque([300, 350, 400])
    )
]
```

### Algorithm-Specific Tests
**Round-Robin Pattern**:
```python
# Expected selection order
round_robin_sequence = [
    "dp_instance_1",  # Request 1
    "dp_instance_2",  # Request 2
    "dp_instance_3",  # Request 3
    "dp_instance_1",  # Request 4 (cycle repeats)
    "dp_instance_2",  # Request 5
    "dp_instance_3"   # Request 6
]
```

**Weighted Distribution**:
```python
# With weights [1, 2, 1], expected pattern
weighted_sequence = [
    "dp_instance_1",  # Weight 1
    "dp_instance_2",  # Weight 2 (first)
    "dp_instance_2",  # Weight 2 (second)
    "dp_instance_3",  # Weight 1
    # Pattern repeats
]
```

**Dynamic Scoring Example**:
```python
# Instance score calculation
score_factors = {
    "connection_ratio": 0.3,      # 30% weight
    "response_time": 0.4,         # 40% weight
    "error_rate": 0.2,           # 20% weight
    "health_status": 0.1         # 10% weight
}
```

### Health Check Scenarios
1. **Healthy to Unhealthy Transition**:
   - 3 consecutive health check failures
   - Instance marked unhealthy
   - Removed from selection pool

2. **Circuit Breaker Recovery**:
   - Circuit open after failures
   - 60-second timeout expires
   - Instance re-enters pool after successful health check

3. **Degraded Performance**:
   - Error rate > 20%
   - Instance marked "degraded"
   - Still selectable but with reduced priority

### Performance Benchmarks
```
Load Balancer Performance Targets:
- Algorithm selection: <5ms per request
- Health check cycle: <100ms for 10 instances
- Sticky session lookup: <1ms
- Metrics update: <2ms per request

    for i in range(1000):
        task = asyncio.create_task(
            load_balancer.select_instance("data_processor")
        )
        tasks.append(task)
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    # Verify even distribution
```

**Instance Failure During Load**:
```python
async def failure_test():
    # Start with 3 healthy instances
    # After 50 requests, mark one unhealthy
    # Verify seamless failover to remaining instances
```

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **PASS**: All routing strategies work correctly, priorities honored, QoS guaranteed
- **FAIL**: Priority violations, missed deadlines, or performance degradation

### Priority Test Scenarios
**Mixed Priority Load**:
```python
test_messages = [
    RoutingRequest(
        message_id="msg_001",
        agent_id="data_processor",
        priority=MessagePriority.CRITICAL,
        qos_level=QoSLevel.GUARANTEED,
        deadline=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=30)
    ),
    RoutingRequest(
        message_id="msg_002",
        agent_id="data_processor",
        priority=MessagePriority.LOW,
        qos_level=QoSLevel.BEST_EFFORT,
        deadline=None
    ),
    RoutingRequest(
        message_id="msg_003",
        agent_id="data_processor",
        priority=MessagePriority.HIGH,
        qos_level=QoSLevel.PREMIUM,
        deadline=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=10)
    )
]
```

**Priority Score Calculation**:
```python
# Base scores by priority
priority_scores = {
    MessagePriority.LOW: 10,
    MessagePriority.MEDIUM: 20,
    MessagePriority.HIGH: 30,
    MessagePriority.CRITICAL: 40
}

# Additional factors
qos_boost = {
    QoSLevel.BEST_EFFORT: 0,
    QoSLevel.GUARANTEED: 5,
    QoSLevel.PREMIUM: 10
}

# Age boost: +1 per minute waiting
# Deadline boost: +10 if <60s remaining
```

### Routing Strategy Tests
**Priority-First Pattern**:
```python
# Expected processing order
priority_order = [
    "critical_msg_1",  # Score: 40
    "critical_msg_2",  # Score: 40
    "high_msg_1",      # Score: 30
    "medium_msg_1",    # Score: 20
    "low_msg_1"        # Score: 10
]
```

**Weighted Fair Distribution**:
```python
# Over 100 time slots
expected_distribution = {
    MessagePriority.CRITICAL: 44,  # 4/(4+2+1+0.25) ≈ 44%
    MessagePriority.HIGH: 22,      # 2/(4+2+1+0.25) ≈ 22%
    MessagePriority.MEDIUM: 11,    # 1/(4+2+1+0.25) ≈ 11%
    MessagePriority.LOW: 3         # 0.25/(4+2+1+0.25) ≈ 3%
}
```

**Deadline-Based Ordering**:
```python
deadline_messages = [
    {"id": "msg_1", "deadline": "now+60s", "priority": "HIGH"},
    {"id": "msg_2", "deadline": "now+10s", "priority": "LOW"},     # Processed first
    {"id": "msg_3", "deadline": "now+30s", "priority": "MEDIUM"},  # Processed second
    {"id": "msg_4", "deadline": None, "priority": "CRITICAL"}      # Processed last
]
```

### QoS Level Testing
1. **Best Effort**: No guarantees, standard queue processing
2. **Guaranteed**: Priority boost +5, delivery assurance
3. **Premium**: Priority boost +10, reserved capacity, zero wait

### Preemption Scenarios
```python
# Preemptible task running
active_low_priority = {
    "message_id": "low_001",
    "priority": MessagePriority.LOW,
    "started_at": "10:00:00"
}

# Critical arrives at 10:00:05
incoming_critical = {
    "message_id": "critical_001",
    "priority": MessagePriority.CRITICAL
}

# Expected: low_001 preempted, critical_001 starts immediately
```

| Instance Count | 3 | Integer | HA Setup |
| Strategy | ACTIVE_PASSIVE | FailoverStrategy | Policy |
| Failure Threshold | 3 | Integer | Health Check |
| Recovery Threshold | 5 | Integer | Failback Policy |

### Test Procedure Steps
1. **Step 1 - Active-Passive Failover**
   - Action: Simulate primary instance failure in active-passive group
   - Expected: Automatic failover to secondary instance within 30 seconds
   - Verification: Traffic routed to new primary, old primary marked failed

2. **Step 2 - Health-Based Failover**
   - Action: Degrade instance health score below 30% through failed health checks
   - Expected: Failover triggered after 3 consecutive failures
   - Verification: Health score tracked, failover decision made at threshold

3. **Step 3 - Circuit Breaker Integration**
   - Action: Trigger circuit breaker open state on primary instance
   - Expected: Immediate failover triggered by circuit breaker event
   - Verification: Circuit breaker state causes failover, no additional health checks

4. **Step 4 - Geographic Failover**
   - Action: Configure GEOGRAPHIC strategy, fail instance in region A
   - Expected: Failover to instance in different region (B or C)
   - Verification: Cross-region failover, not same-region instance

5. **Step 5 - Cascading Failover**
   - Action: Use CASCADING strategy, fail primary and first backup
   - Expected: Cascade through instance list: primary→backup1→backup2
   - Verification: Failover follows cascade order, skips failed instances

6. **Step 6 - Split-Brain Prevention**
   - Action: Simulate network partition with quorum enabled
   - Expected: Only partition with quorum remains active
   - Verification: Minority partition instances marked inactive

7. **Step 7 - Automatic Failback**
   - Action: Recover primary instance, wait for failback delay (300s)
   - Expected: Automatic failback to primary after health verification
   - Verification: Primary resumes service, secondary returns to standby

8. **Step 8 - Manual Failover**
   - Action: Trigger manual failover via API while all instances healthy
   - Expected: Controlled failover to specified target instance
   - Verification: Manual override works, reason logged as MANUAL_FAILOVER

9. **Step 9 - Recovery Queue Processing**
   - Action: Multiple instances fail, then recover at different times
   - Expected: Recovery queue processes instances as they become healthy
   - Verification: Queue maintains order, recovery attempts logged

10. **Step 10 - Performance Under Load**
    - Action: Failover during high traffic (1000 RPS)
    - Expected: Failover completes <5 seconds, minimal request loss
    - Verification: Failover time measured, success rate >99%

### Expected Results
1. **Automatic Detection**: Failed instances detected within health check interval
2. **Quick Failover**: Failover completes within 5 seconds
3. **Traffic Continuity**: Minimal service disruption during failover
4. **State Consistency**: Failover state accurately maintained
5. **Recovery Success**: Failed instances recover and rejoin when healthy
6. **Strategy Compliance**: Each strategy behaves as configured

### Pass/Fail Criteria

    {"check": 7, "success": False, "score": 40},   # -10
    {"check": 8, "success": False, "score": 30},   # -10 (threshold)
    # Failover triggered at score < 30
]
```

**Geographic Distribution**:
```python

    recovery_steps=[
        "Wait for instance to stabilize",
        "Perform extended health checks",
        "Verify service availability",
        "Test with synthetic transactions"
    ],
    estimated_recovery_time=300,
    can_auto_recover=True,
    requires_manual_intervention=False
)
```

```python
# Decision factors
decision_factors = {
    "health_score": 0.4,        # 40% weight
    "response_time": 0.3,       # 30% weight
    "geographic_distance": 0.2, # 20% weight
    "available_capacity": 0.1   # 10% weight
}

# Confidence calculation
confidence = sum(
    factor_weight * factor_score
    for factor_weight, factor_score in factors.items()
)
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```
Failover Performance Targets:
- Detection time: <10s (one health check cycle)
- Decision time: <1s
- Execution time: <5s
- Total failover time: <15s
- Traffic loss: <0.1%
- Recovery time: <5 minutes (auto), <30 minutes (manual)
```

### Split-Brain Test
```python
# Network partition scenario
partition_a = ["dp_instance_1", "dp_instance_2"]  # Has quorum (2/3)
partition_b = ["dp_instance_3"]                    # No quorum (1/3)

# Expected: partition_a remains active, partition_b goes inactive
```

### Stress Test Scenarios
**Cascading Failures**:
```python
# Multiple instances fail in sequence
failure_sequence = [
    {"time": "00:00", "instance": "primary", "reason": "hardware_failure"},
    {"time": "00:02", "instance": "secondary", "reason": "overload"},
    {"time": "00:05", "instance": "tertiary", "reason": "network_issue"}
]
```

**Flapping Instance**:
```python
# Instance repeatedly fails and recovers
flapping_pattern = [
    {"time": "00:00", "state": "healthy"},
    {"time": "00:05", "state": "failed"},
    {"time": "00:10", "state": "healthy"},

        name="Data Product Registration",
        base_url="http://localhost:8001",
        health_endpoint="/a2a/agent0/v1/.well-known/agent.json"
    ),

    "premium": RateLimitConfig(300, 10000, 50)    # Premium tier
}
```

**Circuit Breaker Protection**:
