## Architecture Overview

The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) platform implements a distributed network of specialized agents that process, validate, and manage data products through a sophisticated pipeline. The architecture follows these key principles:

### Core Principles
1. **Agent Autonomy** - Each agent operates independently with specific capabilities
2. **Blockchain Trust** - Trust relationships managed through smart contracts
3. **Protocol Compliance** - All communication follows A2A Protocol v0.2.9
4. **Scalable Processing** - Horizontal scaling through agent distribution
5. **Quality Assurance** - Multi-stage validation and quality control

### System Components
- **16 Specialized Agents** - Each with unique processing capabilities
- **Blockchain Layer** - Smart contracts for trust and identity
- **API Gateway** - Unified access point for external systems
- **Message Bus** - Asynchronous communication between agents
- **Storage Layer** - Distributed data persistence

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Raw Data → Agent 0 (Data Product) → Agent 1 (Standardization) → Agent 2 (AI Prep)
                                                                           ↓
Agent 6 (QC Manager) ← Agent 5 (QA Valid) ← Agent 4 (Calc Valid) ← Agent 3 (Vector)
        ↓
   Approved Data → Publishing/Storage via Agent 8 (Data Manager)
```
