# Agent 5: Quality Assurance & Validation

## Overview

The Quality Assurance & Validation Agent (Agent 5) serves as the final checkpoint in the data processing pipeline before a data product is published or consumed. Its primary purpose is to perform a comprehensive quality assessment and generate final reports. Key responsibilities include:

-   **End-to-End Validation**: Conducts a holistic quality check, verifying the integrity of the data product across its entire processing history.
-   **Rule Enforcement**: Applies a final set of quality assurance (QA) rules, which can cover data quality, business logic, and regulatory compliance.
-   **Report Generation**: Generates detailed compliance and quality reports, providing an auditable record of the data product's journey and its final state.
-   **Approval Workflow**: Manages an approval process, ensuring that data products meet all required standards before being marked as 'approved'.

This agent is critical for ensuring the overall quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of data within the A2A Network.

## API Specification

This agent exposes a RESTful API for performing comprehensive QA checks and generating reports.
